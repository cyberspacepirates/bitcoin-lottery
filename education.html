        WHAT TO DO if I found the private key?
      </h1>
      <p>
        If you find the private key congrats! I’m glad this stupid code I’ve
        written changed someone’s life! But to get those bitcoins
        <strong>IS NOT</strong> so simple.
      </p>
      <p>Why?</p>
      <p>
        Because of <strong>KANGAROOS</strong>! Yes, this
        <strong>IS NOT</strong> a Joke
      </p>
      <p>
        If you read about 160 puzzles, you will notice that some puzzles were
        solved, those harder than the 66th puzzle.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s because they used a different algorithm for that, the Pollard
        Kangoroo, since they have knowledge of the public key and the range of
        the private key.
      </p>
      <h2 id="what-to-do">What to do then?</h2>
      <p>
        If you make a transaction, you will expose the public key, so BOTS
        watching the mempool could try to race your transaction and replace it.
      </p>

      </p>
      <h2 id="the-harder-choice">The harder choice</h2>
      <p>
        There is no safest thing to do here :/ The choice with less risks is to
        mine your own Block and add that transaction on the blockchain. The risk
        is if there is a fork in the blockchain that happens twice a month.

        I wrote this code with typescript with React using Vite, I used the
        bitcoin crate from rust to generate the p2pkh addresses from the private
        key hex.
      </p>
      <p>
        And thanks to the gentleman which has been key hunting and bringing
        information to the brazilian community about that! (I will mention him
        here if he reaches me out)
